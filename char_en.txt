Synopsis of the script "Character decides everything"

Victor receives a call that his best friend owes a large sum just at that happy moment when he finds out about his girlfriend's pregnancy.
He can't stay away and that's where it all starts. With the rest of the money, they start shooting a movie, but it turns out to be not so easy. During the filming, curious cases occur with them, in which they lose each other, then motorcycles with cars.
In the heat of filming, due to an unfortunate coincidence, they destroy an old water tower that feeds a small village.
The video of the incident falls into the hands of a detective and our friends are eager to return it. To do this, they have to participate in surveillance, chases, and also embark on a sea voyage on a cargo ship to France. They are helped to get to Paris by the ex-lover of Victor's friend. However, there they not only do not receive the long-awaited video, but also end up in prison, after serving a term in which they are deported to their homeland, where they are convicted of terrorism.
And yet Victor turns out to be justified thanks to the accidentally found phone of the participant of the video shoot.
Victor comes to his girlfriend's apartment, whom he hasn't seen for almost 5 years.
A small 5-year-old boy opens the door and asks: "Uncle?"


The character defines everything


First title and slogan:
Why when we got good news, inevitably got another one too?

Victor gets two news – good and not so.
The good one: Eugenia says: “I am pregnant”. They smile happily, laugh and hug each other. Then they go across evening street, discussing this event.
Victor's phone is ringing (the bad one). Man's rude voice makes bad expectation. He stands little farther to avoid her anxiety. And furthermore he goes far enough from her, she is in confusion.
- If you want to see your best friend, be tomorrow on the corner of Present and Understone streets at 10 am.
- I want to hear him.
Phone sound disrupts, noise appears, coughing and muffled voice of his friend Rodopia:
- Hello, bro. They already said what they want. Cough-cough, I'd solve it by myself, but there are 5 bulls with lady here… - and his voice interrupted.
- So be there.
<!-- optional element -->
- What's happened? - asks Eugenia with concern, when he returned.
- It's OK, just my friend got some problem. Let's get in “Megafon”.
In the phone company Victor asks consultant:
- Could you say, please, whose number is this?
Consultant is looking at the number and says:
- Sorry, but this is confidential information. We can not help you.
- OK, thanks.
<!-- //optional element -->
At 10 pm he was in the place. And a man was there. Victor goes to him.
- Are you Victor?
- Yes.
- It is for you, - he gives him letter and goes away.
The envelope with bow has inscription: "For Victor only".
He opens the cover and reads note:
"Rodopiy owes us 5 lions (millions). Hurry him up or we will hurry him up to eternal peace and happiness. He is almost there. You can find him on the Lost street in garbage container".
Near container big motorcycle wheel stops. Victor takes off sunglasses, dismounts and goes to bin.
Then he opens the cover of big green crumpled container. We see there fifth point of a man, which bundled by his hands and legs, and he looks down. His breath quivers some paper.
- Why am I not surprised? - he takes his friend out of bin.
- You know me – I can not get caught accidentally, - Rodopiy says when Victor peels off adhesive tape from his mouth. Friend wipes his wry over pain face and mustache when his friend frees his hands.
Victor smiles a little. He likes to see his friend alive and healthy.
- What's happened?
- I resolved to find some money, you know how it feels when you hungry. So I found some wide eyed money-bags and stirs up with them a theme of action movie shooting. Thus everything winds round. In short, we spended about 3-4 millions, it was just an equipment, glasses, motorcycles and different trifles. The shooting protracted about for 2 years, we all need to live, you know. So at last we made show for them, but they did not like it very much so we just ran away. There was not talking about distribution at the time. They found me somehow and said to return everything with interest for moral damage. And you found me here.
- Stupid slush, - he tried to clean up his rubbished and smelling clothes.
- Why the mustache?
- I thought they could not recognize me.
- I recognized.
- Listen, everything's nasty, I am not so good director, and I did not want to involve you. They gave me a month for handle. Otherwise they will initiate a law-court process, and later - complete disaster. I don't want to get in jail, I'll try to hide but then they still will be able to find me. I don't know what to do, Damn, - he presses his hand desperately and strongly in his face. Then adds with hope: - Maybe can I make plastic operation?
- Have you remainder?
- Something about 200-300 thousands. By that money we can do something like a short film.
They say, they do. They bought white used car “Oka” (russian small car) from old man, and second camera in “Eldorado” supermarket (name can be changed) and then got going to Lake Baikal for shooting.
Phone-call in police department from witness of crime:
- A man pushed down a car from steep, n-th kilometer of n-th route near Lake Baikal.
- Thank you, I'll send police patrol there. Could you tell me your personal data, please?
<!-- optional element -->
- and we hear a dial tone.
<!-- //optional element -->
Police department in the morning:
- You are suspected in murder. The seized camera shows that a man was in car.
- He is my friend. We want to shoot the film “The falling from steep”.
- Very original.
- Then something went wrong, he did not float to the surface for a very long time so I dived but could not find him.
- Is it means that he is a tunny?
- Yes, we swim with him since childhood.
The second policeman enters:
- OK, youth, stop talking, - although he sees two forty-year-old men, - it looks like, that all we can impute to him is Lake Baikal pollution. And moreover it is not proven. We got bottom combing results so divers found nothing.
- What? Is his slippery fish lost?
- I would kill him actually for that, - in temper fisherman says, - And how is “Oka”?
- “Oka” is OK.
- Fu-u-u-f, - the suspect breathed out.
- His phone is found but it will never ring again. We'll give an announce about the lost man. So you are free, Mr. Freeman, and you can go, you can get all your things in the waiting room, - older policeman continued.
- Well, I am interested where is he too, - Victor noted, getting up and going to a door.
- But consider, I'm watching you, - first policeman says when he digested the new situation showing by two fingers of his right hand to his eyes and to Victor.
- Thanks, - Victor says closing the door.
Going on foot to his girl he got mobile-phone call:
- Hello, where, the hell, are you? - friend's voice was very annoyed.
- I almost got in jail for murder of you, - Victor parried irritably.
- What a pity that the car's got wet.
- It is drying in department.
- Where?
Later we see how two big men sit in small “Oka” so it almost cracks down. Friend turns the ignition key and the motor starts, so he is very amazed. Exhaust pipe losts clouds of smoke and the car moves away fast. We see old policeman stands arms akimbo, grins and says:
- What a staff, - he shakes his head, drops his eyes and turns around to department.
- What smell is this? - Victor asks looking around in the car.
- Fish of course. Let's go, I'll show you something, - friend says driving car in a funny manner.
They go by nooks, come to some garage, he opens rusty padlock. The ancient dust of decrepit rags go out. It seems like no man's foot was there since stone-age.
We are going into the housing with them. The inner view shows bright sun-lighted entrance of the garage. Rags, trash and tarpaulin are all around.
He plucks a wrap and a motorcycle appears.
Victor, a lover of motorcycles, amazed and exclaims - "Wow!" - comes closer and starts to touch the old machine with admiration. Rodopia smiles satisfied.
- I got it very many, - he shows another farther wraps as dusty as first one.
- I see that you did not spend a money in vain, - friend marvels, - why could not you return the debt in kind?
- Are you crazy? To give them this treasure? And besides, I crashed a half. We need to live, you know. So let's shoot a chase.
- Agh, and did you hope to shoot it without me? - Victor says shaking his head.
Later we see motorcycle goes to the camera and Victor sits on it with sunglasses and looks ahead satisfied and wind blows to him. Then camera moves to the right and we see his friend Rodopiy sits on a bike too, happily swings his arms with enjoy. His helm disrupts, and he almost falls but he has time to correct the direction. He becomes more serious. We see third man going behind them to the left of Victor — great three.
They stops near Datsan (buddhist temple) on Top Birch. They do circle in main temple and go for audience. Rodopia asks about his debt problem, how can he settle it? Monk thinks, reads mantras,
makes divination by his prayer beads, shuffles papers with prays, closing his eyes, goes into a trance, mumbles something, and, at last, opens his eyes and says:
- Not so soon but you'll solve your problems. You have to try hard for that. And beware of water, OK?
On this words friends exchange glances meaningfully, thank the monk and go out. From Datsan's roof ridge we see how three men move away in clouds of dust.
Jump of a big motorcycle from the roof of a garage, hard landing causes wave jiggles of a biker and his bike. Right after that the second bike jumps so we see from the bottom a deep ornament of jackboot of chasing biker in black leather. Now the camera turns following two moving away racers. And immediately notorious “Oka” races past the camera with different cams attached. It goes fast too following them. Shaggy director drives it furiously.
For sometime we see dynamic frames of fast moving across multiple garages and crushed stone flies away with clouds of dust. Suddenly one half-door of some garage opens and a man in cap goes out to get his car outer. But two motorcycles pasts by him with crazy speed, he tried to press himself into the door edge so his cap almost falls down, and then he looks around perplexedly. Later he sees that “Oka” goes to him. He quickly runs into the garage, covering himself by the gates and a car by the miracle did not bring his down. We see how he is awfully gesticulating spinning his finger near his temple with loud shout — he almost jumps because of temper. His cap turned to the side.
But race continues and our three goes out of narrow space to some ruins and ribs of old constructions, everything goes around rapidly before our eyes. Later we see how front wheel of “Oka” blows and car drifts and stops. Our bikers goes far on the hill before they turns around feeling something wrong. Man near car was waving his arms widely like fan trying to attract attention.
- Well, the last frames lost, tire is blown, - Rodopiy says, when they came to him, and everybody shudders over cheerful laughter.
He gets a wrench and starts to change the wheel. Then minivan comes with the man in cap. Man gets out and shout:
- Are you crazy? - guys grow quiet. From the bonnet of “Oka” the face of shaggy director appears.
- Aa, here you are! - man in cap makes move forward to catch the director. Rodopia absentmindedly makes move back and runs to “Oka's” back. They run around the car for some time. Later they do fake moves to the left and to the right. Bikers are laughing merrily. Then “cap” pissed off it, he hurls desperately - "Idiots!" - then gets in a car and drives away angrily.
Later they are on dunes floundering like children. A trick was in synchronous jumping from the hill down to the sand, and Victor must push other biker aside by his leg in the air. Biker in leather falls, of course, but Victor's landing successfully. However we see that all happens conversely, so Victor's falling. Several funny and lost takes like a kick in the air or on the contrary hugging each other. Later we see from side two bikers is flying but one flies normally (Victor) and second man in leather and helmet flies head over heels, at the same time bike wheels was superposed and lower bike looks like floor mirror image. After that take was made in which a chaser jumps from his bike to Victor right in the air trying to seize him, but he can not do that because of his victim bends down  in time pressing himself to the bike, so the flier seizes the air and flies away like “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest”.
Next trick – a wooden column stands about the road. Victor kicks it on the way so it broke and starts to fall. The chaser must bump against it like to a barrier and bike goes forward and upward by inertia. Biker falls on his back and starts to rest. He is indifferent about his bike. Before success column falls after two bikers. In the next take we see how a chaser apprehensively stops before the column and cries:
- Do you think I am a self-murderer?
In shooting process nobody sees strange figure in a coat and a hat except Victor which has a nose for that. Between spokes of the Victor's bike wheel we see how a man hides behind a corner. Victor turns his head to him and strains alarmed.
<!-- optional element -->
And he sneezes and his back tacks over pain of recent injury.
<!-- // optional element -->
Next episode of shooting – a chaser comes closer to our hero and tries to push him to fall by his left hand. Victor by his right hand takes chaser's helmet, pulls it to himself and hit it to helm's right handle so a black helmet glass cracks as if he was astronaut. Then he pushes him aside and a man flies back hitting a ground.
After good take with broken bike and helmet Rodopia shows facebook's like and says to Victor:
- Do you see now why I am a debtor?
Victor smiles. Behind his friend he sees same figure in a dark coat. Rodopia turns around for some reason but the man disappears behind a concrete wall. Victor runs suddenly for him so directors hairs shakes because of the wind. He turns around again and sees how sporty Victor's figure hides behind the wall. Over unexpectedness he exclaims:
- It's not in screenplay!
We see good run of two men. One, in long coat, runs by zigzags other runs strictly direct. First looks like a maypole and scrawny with short breath and the second is harmoniously developed and runs effectively like terminator will run forever. First tries to dodge and tangle his trace going between garages and constructions but second isn't falling behind but getting closer. First tries to hold his hat because apparently he was attached to it strongly. Later a narrow place begins with beam cranes and blocks. First runs mincing on the log forcedly overcoming dangerous stonewalling, and his figure looks funny like ballet dancer. He looks like Michael Jackson with his moonwalk. The second widely and fast steps right on the log with confidence of antelope. Later they comes to steep and first slips there on his legs forward almost sitting on his coat like falling skier without skies. At that moment we see Victor runs by the log and jumps high from it with turnover into the steep like water jumping champion lands into the swimming pool. And by this move he finds himself right before the runner and turns around to him closing a way.
He grabs a man by the lapels:
- Who're you? What do you want?
He answers stuttering owing to shock:
- I'd, I'd been hired to watch your director.
- What for?
- He owes to my clients a big money. I'm just doing my job. Let's burke it, OK? All the more you've burked my clothes already.
A little later:
- Who was that? - Rodopiy asks with emotion.
- He's a detective and your creditors hired him.
- Oh, please, don't tell me about the creditors, - friend writhes fully of suffering, - we've made almost a half of the film. We just need to visit a pair of boutiques.
- What for? - asks astonished Victor throwing up his brow.
- Trust me.
- It scares.
- On the days I'll call you for shooting. Get rest.
After long dream mobile phone wakes him up:
- Yes?
- Where, the hell, are you?
- Ha-ha.
- Come to n-th kilometer of n-th road at 7 pm. You can take a car in car rental on Rental street. Say that you are from me.
Black screen. Gradually it's getting lighter and a circle silhouette appears, camera continues to zoom out and we see that the circle is exhaust tube of a car which losts a white-bluish clouds of smoke and the car moves away fast. At this time it was black Toyota Chaser (car may be changed).
A man in sunglasses drives a car, we see evening sun's reflection on a face of fashionable watch which shows 5 pm (here you can set your advertisement).
Through car's windscreen we see Victor's strong-willed face with pushed-together brows and compressed lips, light and thin features. He takes off sunglasses and talks by phone turning steering wheel dashingly. Later we can hear his talking with his friend:
- I'm out.
- OK!
- I'll be there in about two hours.
- Good, we need your arms.
- I'm on link.
- OK.
He moves on the bridge and leaves the town. Through the window we see planes, hills and trees.
Road sign with spoon and fork. He stops near road cafe.
He orders buuza (buryad meal – vapour-boiled meatforce in a pastry with a top hole), sits to the little table near the window. Eating. A man with his order on a tray comes to sit near him:
- May I?
- Yes, of course.
The man sits opposite, puts his dishes on the table with tissue paper and making himself comfortable.
- Beautiful days! Not cold, not hot, - he says with kindly smile.
Slowly chewing Victor looks at the guest with some distrust.
- Ughm, - Victor nods.
- But as I see you are not so interested about a weather? - asks the guest.
- The sun plays hide-and-seek with clouds funny but I've interested about a weather to the west from here.
- Do you go far?
- Yes.
- Well, the weather to the west is surprising, can be to cold or hot, global warming or coldness you know. And beware of trucks…
- What about?
- There is an awful felling out there so they hurry without signals going fast.
- Thanks for warning.
- You are welcome.
Victor stands up and goes to a car. And we see how it moves away. A talker looks to him and smiles puzzling.
We see a red sunset. Victor turns near lights to far. Dark road with running trees.
Victor starts to nod off to sleep. He shakes himself and goes further. Like a snake the white-dashed road whirls. Radio wheezes losing or finding some wave. He turns it off. Silence comes and only wheels rustling is making sound when they go by shaken asphalt.
Sleep's coming again. Car is going to a counter lane. A bright headlights with increasing loud signal wake him up. He turns back on his line.
And here a presentiment of danger and some anguish appears. Monotony of road and his life is hiding some phantom menace.
Victor decided to smoke. Maybe it can help to embolden and excurse. He takes a lighter and takes cigarette from a pack, burns its edge and inhales. And he looks at the cigarette. His life so simple, useless, conformed and short, as this cigarette. And he smokes his life slowly and indifferently. In his eyes we see reflections of some grief. What is that?
Red triangle on the ground flashed ahead – and later car was lighted by headlights. Victor slows down and looks closely. A guy was changing the front right wheel.
- A road is full of surprises, - driver thoughts.
We see the sign “Dangerous turns”. And they begins.
Victor sees ahead something little and red looms and dances to the left and to the right as on a waves. It starts to strain.
When he comes closer he sees something flowery and big and a little red light becomes a stop-light of a timber lorry.
- OK, - he thinks, that man in cafe tells a truth – a truck. But it is shaggy - strange loaded – they even didn't cut off boughs… OK, let's go.
He starts to overtake – he winks twice by headlights and gives two sound signals. Nobody comes from behind and far ahead no lights was in sight. He starts to turn and speed up.
But at that time something happens. Lorry suddenly starts to beep loudly and quickly turns to the left too closing a way. So all his length was lighted by Victor's car headlights.
- Hey, what the hell are you doing? - Victor shouted and brakes. The truck like a caterpillar slowly wriggles and starts to stop scratching by its all 18 wheels. It was awful show.
Victor's car stops on the left roadside. A woman squats down on the road holding her head by her hands. He didn't hit her by the miracle.
The truck tries to detour her.
Victor about 5 seconds sits in car to come to his senses.
The truck at last stops and a clouds of dust with smoke starts to clear away.
Silence and still came. Door clicks and car light switched on. Victor turns around and looks to the woman. She gets up. It means that she is OK. At least physically. (Mylene Farmer style music starts to play slowly and quietly – so cold and doomed, a little strange and scary).
Victor quickly outs and goes to her.
And farther we see running truck driver.
When Victor comes closer he saw her features. Young girl about 25-30, with modern dark clothes, red long curly hairs. Red leather bag on a shoulder, black leather jacket. She stands sideways to him looking back to the void and understanding nothing. Cold death touch flutters from her. She was too close to die...
Victor stands in amazement — so young girl here on the road at this late time?
She turns her head slowly to him. Her right eye was closed by curl, but left eye looks at him. Her aristocratic thin face was lighted a little by faint moon reflection.
He makes effort to break the silence and bonds of charming:
- Are you OK?
She just nods a little, quickly and convulsively coming to.
Truck driver is arrived. Heavy breathing he stands near and examines then windy.
 - Are you, guys, OK? - he almost shout.
- Yes, I think… - girl speaks in low.
- But she is in shock probably, - Victor says to driver.
- We all shocked apparently! Are you crazy lady to walk here alone at this time? - still hard breathing driver shouts angrily, - You could die here!
She looks to him with sickly-doomed expression and makes no sound.
- OK, I will take her to a hospital. Do you know where the closest? - Victors asks driver. It seems that he came to.
- It's about 50 kilometers forward, - driver shows the direction by his arm.
- Please let's go, - he says to girl giving an arm to her. The girl lubberly goes to car leaning on his shoulder.
- Thanks, and don't worry, I'll take care of her, - Victor says to driver, helping her to sit on the front passenger seat.
- OK, OK, good… - driver says wiping sweat from his round face, – Can it be happened, Ha? What the hell is going on here? Fu-u-u-f — still thinking about it he goes to truck…
Victor quickly gets in car and looks to a girl. She was looking fragile and weak at the moment like she was under rain just now. Although there was no rain.
- Very strange, - Victor thoughts. But no time to think – he starts a car and moves softly. Detouring a truck he says:
- Please, be patient, help is close…
She just slowly looks at him and to a window leaning to it by her head and seeing a dusk…
Dark turns is very guileful so he drives very careful. Furthermore he was with casualty although she got off lightly. But something wrong was with her. He feels it but does not understand how could she be there in such wilderness alone, from what moon was she fall. Besides, the moon was full and winks by one crater almost smiling…
Sometimes he looks at her – she is quiet and resigned. Her breath was cold. A heater works but she is cold anyway… He almost sees a vapour from her mouth…
- What the hell, it is just a cold night comes — Victor tries to reassure himself and scratches his ear funny… A little rain's came down and he turns on windscreen wipers.
She seems got to asleep sometimes opening her eyes because of pushes of the car when Victor goes through irregularities. Certainly she was weakened after shock.
But Victor still was in perplexity of her strange appearance on the desert road at late time. He asks himself about it all the time but he could not find the answer.
Slow opera style music starts to play. The car goes confidently flowing smoothly road turns. He was infused with this beautiful dark driving, besides he was not alone. It is pleasant twice.
We see the car from behind, and silhouettes of his head and her hairs. Then car starts to move away with bright red lights.
We see the car from front, serious face of Victor and sleeping beauty. He looks at the road attentively, then turns to her with care and returns his look forward again. The car is turning brightly lighting the camera by headlights. Victor playing with the road having fun and getting peace…
We see a side window in witch the girl slumbers uneasily a little leaning her head to it. Raindrops slips backward by the wind.
In an hour they was about the hospital…
Opera music is getting quiet.
The car stops lull her and she awakes.
- Let me help you to come out, - Victor says getting out of the car.
He opens her door and she says:
- I do not want to the hospital, I'm OK now.
He is taken aback:
- How? – he asks, – You need to recover over the shock, and at all you'd better pass a medical examination.
- Please, it's not necessary.
- Excuse me but I'm insist, please let me help you. You'll get all necessary help in the hospital.
- OK. Let me do it on my own, – she comes to annoyance, finds her bag and gets out angrily looking at him.
He tried to see her to the door but she declines it. She went into the brightly lighted entrance of the hospital.
Victor's car is moving out. Through the passenger window we see like in a fog how she is talking with person on duty in admitting office. Strange delusion starts to disappear. Usually loneliness comes again.
We see his face – he feels keenly. He wipes his face, turns his head to make a turn. He just darkened and feels upset, his eyes reddened and got wet.
The car is going in the dark. We see from side a road sign and columns flies past his car, and the side window is opened, driver hardly holds a steer. From behind we see how car is going by zigzag. The driver is in disturbance and tries to control the situation. The lonely moon looks into car window. The car from behind is dodging and moving forward. A senseless music plays in it. We see a gate railway crossing signs.
Red stop-signals lights brighter just before a closing gate – a car stops scratching tires. The clouds of sand and crushed stone dust with smoke uprises. We hear ringing of a coming train and see a railway traffic lights with red on it.
The train is passing by his eyes. The occiput and a moving train which goes to end. The gate opens. Green light. The car stands.
The camera goes around the car to its front and to a driver's face. It is stoned and concentrated.
The car makes big U-turn on empty road and goes back.
He enters to the hospital and asks about a recent girl. They asks him who is him to her. He said that he just gave her a lift to the hospital when she walks alone by the road. They conducted him to her.
We see opening ward door and laying in the bed girl looks to him. Her eyes goes down and closes. He comes closer and sits next to.
- Are you OK?
- Yes, now I'm fine, thanks.
- Can I help you?
- No, thank you.
- But I still do not understand how did you get the lone road?
Heavy silence. Tears comes from her eyes.
- We was going in a car with my boyfriend, - her voice is trembling and breaking over sighs of pain and regret, - We squabbled, I was stupid and crotchety, I am often so. The quarrel starts over trivia but when I start I can not stop. He tolerated me sometime trying to calm down but I exasperated him hard.
Then she breathes out and continues:
- Then I decided to punish and scare him, demanded him to stop and got out, went forward across the road. He complained as always about my obstinacy but I did not listen and went forward. He followed me for sometime and tried to urge me to get in car. I was inexorable trying to show him who he deal with. He drove until he got some nail of roadside. I turned around and saw that he retarded and got out of a car looking to the wheel. I thought that it should be, ha-ha, and continued to go although the night was close. I was mischievous and drank much beer. I felt sick – oxygen intoxication, - she grins a little, - I began to get tired, the darkness comes, the road was lit only by the moon and turns to the left or to the right, I started to get cold and to regret about my trick. Then the road starts to get narrower, the roadside, I mean. I almost went by the road surface. I tried to be careful but there were too much fast moving trucks and I lost a control. The steep starts from the right side and I scared to fall there, - and she look at him with her big innocent eyes, - so I went by the road and tried to walk out fast from that awful place. Then I saw a bright light behind and was unable to control myself – I just cowered down on the road. I wanted to cry because of resentment and fear, I just pressed in myself to the road and tried to forget everything as a nightmare. My pride did not let me to back to Andrey (he is my boyfriend), - she looks at Victor.
He knowingly and compassionately nods.
- Now you will be OK, - he smiles.
She smiles a little in response. Her phone rings. Victor goes out from the ward.
His phone rings too:
- Hello, where are you?
- Road problems I have met. Shooting? What about? Am I late?
- We’re waiting for a cat. When will you come and get?
- About half-hour, let me bet.
Getting in car Victor intuitively pays attention to unnoticeable car aloof.
Lights in rear-view mirror looms suspiciously and do not remain behind. Victor wipes his face and feels some chasing:
- Nonsense! She says that she’d drink much beer but smells of expensive perfume.
Headlights disappeared. The hero calms down.
- No more cheap actions, - Victor thought coming to place.
- Got tired of waiting for you! - Rodopia shouts gaily going to a car. Victor gets out of a car.
- Just look at this beautiful place! - Rodopia admires of the environment contented that he brings his friend here. Victor looks around and sees only dark twilight and feels astringent smelling of pine needles. The looms tells that hills was around here covered with dense fir-wood and high-voltage line towers.
- Trees’ smell’s great, - he said.
Night shooting was tiring, intensive and dangerous enough. Headlights of two cars and two bikes almost till dawn rushed about here and there. In one episode a bike comes alongside Victor’s car and we see how the biker gets ready to hit the driver’s door window by his elbow. Victor’s hero opens car’s door on the move and pushes the biker away. We see how the door closes after the trick and there is a piece of a foam plastic on it to prevent a door and a biker scratches.
They explored the area and the road for a long time to properly and safely drive around this plot with high speed and without both self and technical damage.
We see fast spinning bike wheel draws level with back right car wheel and then we see quick maneuver of the driver to the left and a car’s back comes to the biker, back wheel skidded and pushed the biker right to the camera. We see that the foam plastic was glued to the left side of the bike.
At that time the next biker appears from the left and starts to overtake. Victor’s hero says disappointedly:
- When will you come to an end, kids?
They raced for some time by the night way scaring the neighborhood by loud roar of motors, jumping on the tussocks, roaming by the steering wheel, like the hounds on fire of hunt. Then Victor’s car shifts to the left pushing the biker to the roadside. The stake was dug into the ground and comes from the left side of the car, the biker tries to pass it from the left where a ditch lies so he jumps and rolls pictorially falling from the sky like a shooting star.
- That’s all, now let’s get rest, guys! - Rodopia instructs about night shoot ending with satisfaction and loudly clapping his hands.
- I dreamt to get rest in the tent with cup of tea for a long time, - Victor mutters. Shaggy director was sitting near drinking hot tea from a cup.
- Do you want an old joke?
- It's the first thing we want now!
- They ask a people that was lost in the forest: “What did you do in the forest?” They answer: “We ate a pines”.
- Ha-ha-kha, - and he dropping his head immediately gets sleep.
The phone ring’s awaking in the morning:
- Where are you lost?
- In the tent.
- OK, come here now, we start working.
- OK.
Victor drives to shooting place and a leggy beauty stands there with the morning bluish-pink sky on the background. From the car it seems that her stature is not less than the height of the water tower.
The car stops right before her. The driver gets out off a car, takes off his sunglasses and fastens his amazed gaze upon her. He tries to put the glasses into the breast pocket but he missed for several times.
And here shaggy director comes:
- Hi there, let me acquaint you to each other, this is incomparable Rose, and this is my best friend and just a good man Victor.
Victor funny confused of this introduction:
- He overstates it, - his gaze involuntarily rises to the sky.
The girl nods and favorably smiles from the height.
- And I’m not overstating at all. So let’s get start it, children! - he loudly and sweepingly claps his hands again turning to the crew.
Victor turns to a car and we see the picture on the hood with big good-natured dragon’s head in realistic style which was not without charming and almost smiling and trying to take a nap but just in case showing his forked tongue.
- Do you know what is the name of this township? - Rodopia asks looking into the door-window of a car trying to impress with his ethnographic knowledge.
- And what?
- Abutting-Hill. It is because it flanks to that beautiful mountain behind you.
- OK, I’ll take it into account.
They needed to move fast near the water tower, but the way surface was not so good, it was old rotten and lopsided wood boards which came down and rose like a very old parquet so the car was shaking and jumping very much. The director needed exactly that effect. And a driver’s head was shaking too. The driver felt uncomfortable a little and spared the car.
Dynamic frames was achieved but the director wanted more and asked to make new several takes to have a choice. The planking lamentably crackle and fracture.
- The surface left to wish more! - stopping next time Victor worries.
- Yes, I know, let’s do it for last time.
Unwillingly Victor makes U-turn, accelerates and rushes past near the water tower once more. And then from under the right rear wheel a wooden bar flies up so some brick or stone jumps up, makes an arc and lands behind the crew near the water tower. The director shows all his rich nasal flora when he pulls up his head following the stone’s flight above him. Then everybody turn around. The stone lands near a steep. All breathed out with relief. But incline was significant already and the stone starts to roll down to the steep. The anxiety returns on people faces and exclamations of dread sound again.
The rustle of falling stones is heard below, then some stroke of metal sounds and the silence comes. The camera shows that the stone strikes a rusted girder or bolt of water tower bearing. Everything holds up some time but later we see some wobble and the fissure grows because of water weight. The creak of old steel sounds and one pier of water tower bends, the tower slowly careens and the old dingy greenish tower head droops down faster and faster. The mushroom of the water tower saying “good bye” waves to onlookers his old hat and sinks into the deep of the steep. There are disarray, fear and bitter regret on faces of the crew. That were the indescribable grimaces from the best horror movies, like mischiefed teens fear of their parents and others.
Next events are a complete chaos. All crew members throwing everything runs to their cars to crazy fast leave the place of incident. Girl named Rose can run provided to be very quickly thanks to the length of her slender legs. She is in hard regret about her contact with this company. And soon she hides over the hill, then catches a taxi and leaves the town.
At first seeing nothing Victor makes U-turn, sees suddenly changed landscape, accelerates and moves to the place of event. He sees there abandoned cameras and his shaggy friend with the foam in a mouth and bitten till the blood fingers. It was really like a hydrophobia, but more insane – he was unable to see what is going on at present. In his usually cheerful eyes dismal perspectives loom.
Victor gets out the car and looks around trying to understand what is happened here in this seconds. In the distance all cars starts off like a crazy throwing camps and things. One thing was indisputable – the water tower was here and now it is not. Then he sees that at some distance a camera lies. Most likely it can explain everything. He understands that he must to see it.
All of a sudden some figure in coat goes out and intends to move to the camera too. Emulative moment appears. From the crouch they run to camera. But at this time the “coat” has advantage and time to take the camera and change the direction going to the left from Victor. Suddenly grand jeep pushes Victor away to the right and he falls near his inadequate friend. He sees the “night road girl” in that jeep. She cries:
- Andrey, quicker!
The “coat” quickly gets in car and they moves backward fast turning around on the way.
Victor does push-up and stands on feet and desperately stays near his friend clenching his fists. He has look like the kid was bereft of candy.
He tries to calm down his friend and persuades him to get in car. From far away the siren sounds come here.
With difficulty he puts his friend on a passenger seat and rushes fast. They have to make U-turn to get away from police cars. Moving through 3-floor houses at the bottom of the hill Victor sees the aftermath – some first floors of the houses was flooded by fresh water. From the doorways barefooted ragged kids with mothers look around. In his eyes it becomes a world catastrophe. Starving deprived children and the global warming. With ache in heart Victor steers further due to deafening siren howling behind.
Somehow they run away from the police because of their small quantity and not so long chasing.
Victor opens a door-window of a car and throws his phone away which falls with clattering on the asphalt breaking apart.
- Give me the phone.
- What for? - Rodopia recoils perplexedly – he was still unable to think normally.
- Just give it to me!
He unwillingly takes out his phone. Victor quickly snatches and throws it away too.
- Never do that again! - Rodopia screams.
- They listen us for a long time.
At the morning on TV-news:
- Yesterday morning in the Abutting-Hill a water-tower was crashed and multi-storey housing lost water-supply. Now it is under repair work, and victims receive all necessary help. All services do all for fastest incident consequences remove.
- We think that this is a terrorism, - police officer talks quite seriously, - we have two suspects of this crime organization.
Two identikits appear on the screen – faces are distorted but we can recognize our director and his friend.
- Everybody who have any information about this incident are invited to help us in catch of these dangerous criminals.
Then we see results of witness interrogation in particular of a man in hat:
- That was a special forces, he had perfect physical training, SAS, SEAL, marines or something. I saw how he works – he is a real professional diversionist.
- Excuse me but who are you?
- I am from detective agency “Moon reflection”.
- And you tell me that town abuts to the mountain… - Victor says with sadness to laying near on the bed friend.
- What have we done? Now we will be in worldwide search, - his friend wheezes unhealthy and constrainedly.
On these words Victor’s head droops down at all. He remembers his girl-friend Eugenia. Now he cannot explain something to her.
- We better get buried and better forever, - Rodopia whines.
- But we are innocent! - Victor fires up.
- You’ll say it in police but let me avoid that pleasure.
- I know it because it’s really so!
- They would not listen us, I am a debtor, you are a decent swimmer. And we have no evidence, everything against us!
- I know where is the evidence!
- What?
- The detective has it.
- In this beard you looks just incredibly funny! - Rodopia laughs looking at his standing near friend in the mirror.
- And you looks like a Santa Claus! - Victor adds and bursts into laughter.
- And however good that even in such situation we still can laugh, - for some reason now Rodopia sadly adds.
- Don’t worry, everything’s gonna be OK, - Victor tries to calm down his friend taking his shoulder, - you know we always win.
Two bearded men go into many-storied business-center, rise up by escalator, turn to the left going to the one of many offices.
- You are welcome, can I help you? - smiling girl in reception of detective agency “Moon reflection” politely greets newly brought to light clients.
- Good day, do you know, we have some delicate question, let me explain, - also wide-smiling Rodopia tries to put her in the picture.
- You may have a seat, please, - with care girl says showing on chairs and settees in the reception room.
- Oh, yes, thank you, - Rodopia says, - can you see, the question is…
Meanwhile Victor makes a nod and moves aside, sits in deep sofa and looks around. He sees an entrance to inner room where agency’s officers sit.
One of them stands up, and he is just our old-hat in coat but without hat and coat and in well-suited old costume.
- Pedant, - Victor mutters to himself.
And in his hands we see well-known dust-laden videocamera. Victor almost jumps on his place. He just looks at talking people and wavers.
At some distance we see how man in suit walks around the table talking gaily about something. Probably he just came and now he is going to tell his friends a great news. And then Victor losts his temper and forgetting convenances darts off his place into the room. Detective immediately flees to the emergency exit and his friends opening their mouths stay to sit on the couches.
- Sorry, I have to go, - good partner Rodopiy with the same velocity moves away and by his way he just almost knocks down old respectable woman, has time to fix up her haircut and to make his apology to her and disappears in the corridors.
A man with camera in his hands runs funny and flowery through the corridor almost with customary  and risk to get hooked by the belt of the camera to fire-cock or banisters. Behind him bearded Victor comes fast and his beard comes unstuck a little flying on the wind. But who cares?
The runner stops before banisters and looks down – too high, people walk on the shining marble floor. He turns to the escalator that goes up and he must move his legs with double fast pushing aside discontented up-going visitors. Victor runs after him, hangs over the banisters and jumps down.
The “Suit” understanding that he has no time decided to jump on the garland hanging from big ceiling on some distance from banisters of second floor. Lamps blow, sparks splash and screams of turning visitors ring. Then on the second liana other man hangs and with dexterity of Mowgli changes his arms going to the first climber. And that man falls down blowing more and more round lamps. From the second liana immediately after him the chaser slides down. We see how from the second floor another bearded man bends down, then quickly moves down by downward escalator and incidentally rebukes a security guard which in bewilderment shouts something in transceiver trying to get out his baton:
- Clean up here, - and he headlong races past him.
All runners rush out through the front access door to the street and run in indefinite direction.
The oil-paint picture – tree sound men run, two of them are bearded, but the second one tears his beard out and throw it away on the way. They approach to the bridge, breath of first one falls, and he stops near the bridge’s banisters and tries to get something out of his coat. And then Victor comes and pushes him on the pavement so that man looses videocamera which makes another arc of its biography. In spite of tries to catch it by its belt it falls down on the asphalt city road. Fortunately and prospectively at that moment a truck with stuff and things of migrating family moves down there. Victor remembers the number of a truck and reckons where to it go. At that moment Rodopia runs near him and kicks Andrey’s arm with licensed gun trying to aim to Victor. The gun makes same arc and flies out the banisters but its fall was not so lucky with asphalt landing.
Then Victor understand that better not to loose the truck and jumps over the banisters.
- What are you doing? - Rodopia with fear screams, - Vi-i-i-t-y-i-a-a-y!
He comes to the banisters closing his eyes by his hand, draws apart his fingers and looks down with one eye. Andrey laying on his side convulsively pulls himself to banisters and tries to look there too. We see how Victor’s head turning to the left and to the right helps him to move down by the bridge beams and dangles legs down in waiting for convenient moment. And it comes of course as a big bus so he jumps down on its roof and runs backward, slides down by the ladder on the bus back and runs to roadside where bike-seller slumbers and see nothing of that.
He was not ready when some sporty man with doubtful intentions comes, grabs one of speed bikes and rushes away. On the question - “Hay, what are you doing?! - he throws from his Arshani-jeans pockets some papers:
- Test drive, I’ll bye it certainly! - and he disappears.
Bike-salesman takes the paper and reads on it old phone number of terrorism suspect and some blue-red banknotes.
- Sales go, - seller gets gladness.
Rodopia grasps quickly that he must be down there too and stamping his foot on the Andrey’s breast, jerking up his nose exclaims:
- Lay down, reptile!
He stops a taxi, sits on it quickly, impatiently rotates his hands meaning something like “ok, move away, go, later I’ll say you where to” and goes away. From the taxi’s window we see how man near banisters gets up and cleans up his cloths looking pityingly on his shabby image.
A little later detective comes to bike-seller and asks:
- What did he give you?
- This is, - he takes out the calling card. Andrey disappointedly looks on the visit-card – the information was old.
- What else?
- Nothing, he just bought a bike with gratuity and gave the slip.
Then we see how black leather and helmet biker was left behind by cyclist in white T-shirt and jeans. He sees only one aim – the truck with number BAM 777 on the body.
All stops on red traffic lights, the biker stops also looking strange and hopeless at the cyclist which continues to move following the truck passed the traffic lights before far forward.
He almost catches the truck and goes near it but he did not know how to approach it.
And here the truck’s driver roughly breaks the traffic regulations and gets the whistle of point duty officer and the signal to stop on the roadside. He stops and pushes to the roadside. Inspector goes to the truck.
Victor slightly slows down and goes around the truck from the left, looks behind to be sure that no cars there, leans his bike against the truck’s back wheel, jumps on the truck body, takes the camera and jumps out listening a conversation about what point of traffic regulations was faulted by the truck driver which as always tries to justify his actions. Than Victor takes the bike, hanging the camera on his shoulder, sits on the bike and runs away like free bird.
At home if we can call so their new place to be they unfortunately find out that the camera was broken a little so its data storage card was damaged. It was necessary to disassemble the camera to take storage out. It was some split on the body so in the Victor’s laptop it shows only takes precisely until the most important moment.
- Damn! - Victor cries angrily.
Rodopiy wipes his face and says:
- Wait, maybe it is not lost… I have familiar hatzcker, he’ll try to decode.
- Naa, it seems to me that your picture is dead, - cool hatzcker with little moustache makes friends unhappy. Friends sadly look at each other.
- Well if your comrade is not fool, and he is not fool more likely, he made a copy of video on other storage, notebook or something, I do not know.
- O, yea? - with hope friends light out.
- Kha-kha, well yea, I’d do so.
- So, help us friend, we will die without you! - enthusiastically Rodopiy declares, - how can we get it?
- Well, I don’t know, you’d better know. I just need only his computer or notebook, and maybe his cloud password.
- His cloud password? - almost bursting of laughter and understanding nothing friends look at each other.
Now a man without cap and hat watches Andrey doing it professionally and unhurriedly in the elephant or crocodile costume.
Later we see him behind the corner of a gate near the detective’s house. That was a beautiful and many-storied newly-erected building in the prestige district.
- Do you want to be the spider-man? - Rodopiy asks contentedly stretching ropes and cables in his hands.
- I dreamed about it all my life.
He jumps head down from the roof of high building in the dusk. From behind we see how Rodopia rotates the winch by the rope lowering his friend down which like Houdini approaches to his fond aim – the window on the middle floor. He lowers lower and lower window by window closer to it. And then in one of windows curious face of a girl looking by her big eyes at the stranger appears.
- Mommy, spider-man there! - girl cries. The voice from the deep: - Who?
- Ts-s-s! - Victors hisses pressing his lips by his finger, and in a low voice, - This is our secret! Where are you from hatch out?
- From the egg.
- So get in there back.
- OK.
Then he lowers down further holding the side of the windows to avoid self-shining. Then we see how round forehead appears from the top of a window. The eyes are serious like ninja’s. He extends his arm insensibly and puts some bug like a ladybird in the window’s corner and the forehead smoothly slips away upward.
The long cable slowly lifts up a man.
- Perfect, signal is OK, everything's visible, - a voice sounds in Rodopia’s radio station. On the edge of the roof they left a little snail-retranslator.
They sit at home and drink some coffee.
- He sits and reads a letters, apparently, - hatzcker Dima comments.
- First of all, find a cloud password! - Rodopia jokes. Dmitriy rolls up his eyes.
A little later:
- Yes! Got it! - Dmitriy cries.
Friends wake up, although they laid side by side anywhere, one was on the sofa, another was on the chair. Rodopia nozzles swell abruptly showing active moving of inner flora, and funny grunt.
- Key-pressing was mirrored on the glass cup when he entered it. Not so original – Superman343.
- Why 343? - Rodopiy asks darkly.
On the Andrey’s flat door we see the number – 343.
- It explains everything, - Victor thoughtfully pronounces. Then they hear somebody’s steps going upstairs. They quickly step away of the door to lift and make careless image talking about nonsense:
- So, where, you tell, did you found that lovely Rose?
- Well, how, in flower-shop of course.
People goes by and our heroes relaxes.
Then they hear steps behind the door and press their bodies into the wall as statues.
- Quiet, he can suspect something, - Victor chafes.
- Yea. To the lift.
They by the walls ooze to the lift and call it.
On the fresh air Rodopia gets his breath back, comes to his senses smoking a little and says:
- So what?
The same question on the face of Victor.
And here Rodopia’s radio gives a signal. Clicks in ears on switch on makes Rodopia to shirk away of it:
- Yes?
- Well, retreat, guys, he talked by the phone, and...it seems to be he got a business trip.
- Where?! - guys almost cry.
In airport as usually many people walk, not too many, but good enough. Near the entrance orange taxi stops. Andrey respectfully dressed gets out of it and goes in.
A little further our known Oka stops. Two bearded outs of it. One of them says:
- Oka is my favorite because of its inconspicuousness.
- Agreed, - bearded nods. They lazily moves to the entrance with unconcerned and unpretentious image talking about something unimportant. Perching the window friends continue talking sometimes looking at the ticket windows and passport control.
- Agh, shoot, we can never pass it, - Rodopia grieves.
- Well, ye… - friend agrees.
- Boom, boom, boom, boom...Dear passengers, now boarding on the flight to Paris starts, board number is 445 of “Sky Line Pacific” airline. Please proceed to pass gate number 6 and go to a boarding. I repeat, Dear passengers... Boom, boom, boom, boom...
- Damn, he will fly away now, - Rodopiy angers, clenching his fist and striking the air downward, - with our alibi!
- Quiet, you’re attracting attention, - Victor exerts himself, - let’s go out. At least we know where we can find him, - he looks intently at a tall man in yellow coat which go to a boarding.
At home:
- So, it means that he flies there by Aeroflot planes but we flies away as a veneer above the Paris, - funny imitating airport announcements Rodopiy says. Guys laugh but immediately become serious.
- We must be there, - Victor says.
- How? - Rodopia asks, - hitch-hiking?
- Let’s see, - Dima reasons, - you cannot get there by plane, and by hitch-hiking. In other words by air and land are no variants. What about water? He will be there about a month for experience exchange so you have a time.
- Swimming through the ocean? Yes, we can swim but it will take several years to get there. And do you remember the Lama’s warning? - on these words Dima’s brows slightly go up.
- It passed away long ago, and if to think it’s real variant, a ship is big, in bilge of it we can hide like sardines, - Victor cheers up, - and if we need we’ll make a raft and sail for several years, we’re about to get a prison term so it’s indifferent! - he angers again.
- OK, guys, back to work, back to work! Are you still here? - they laughter merrily.
Night in port:
- How can we get a needed board?
- Look and learn! - Victor makes a swallow-dive from the shore. A second diver jumps behind him.
Men in dark water swim to ship’s rostrum along the board from other side of the shore. First of them clings to massive chain link and climbs up. Second one follows. The beam of searchlight illuminates a ship’s board. They press themselves into the chain hiding behind. The beam goes away and they continue climbing. At last they approach to a hole in the board from where anchor chain outs and get in. It is quiet and dark in the room. They almost by touch skulk down by the ladder to hold and cargo compartments. A man goes around and they pressed themselves into the floor squating down. A man goes away and they continue moving among the tubes and flooring grids. They slip down and look around. Big space of inner cargo block offers a range for lading and technics placing. There is a place to hide here. They move along containers sometimes pressing themselves to it when man in hard hat was coming closer.
- I need a helmet too, - Rodopiy whispers.
- We’ll get it, - Victor says and in time he gives a cherished helmet to his friend. He has the same helmet on his head too. And here somebody calls them from above:
- Hey, what do you loaf about there?
Friends harshly hang their heads and with exclamation «Oh, yea, yea, we go now» quickly take some bales and carry it further. There are fear and horror near Mars. Man above goes away.
They hide themselves between containers covered some nets and standing still get sleep.
Victor suddenly wakes up because of loud hooter and harsh stroke which causes ship rolling.
Anchor chains rustle.
- It means we depart, - quietly Rodopia says after awakening.
- Stowaway, - Victor adds.
They smile.
They bear up about 12 hours but then legs become numb. They must do something with it.
- I’ll stretch my legs, - Victor says and goes to out.
- Stop, where are you? - Rodopiy gets scared.
- Follow me.
They out and go like always to back side of the ship. They come to the stern, look at the beauty of the ocean and the sky under bright sunlight, rest with souls.
And then a man in helmet comes to them and asks:
- Who are you guys?
- We are loaders.
- I see, but I can’t remember you, we all registered, are we?
- Oh, yea, registered, but we passed it a little later because of a delay, - Rodopia tries to slip away.
- Aha, there was some hitch there, - Victor affirms.
- What a hitch? I should know about that, I’m a senior here and the staff is my responsibility.
- Ah, oh! We searched you! - Rodopiy quickly finds the right word to say.
- Aha, - Victor “rejoices” at that.
- We had a problems with official procedure and want to discuss it with you.
- Well?
- The problem is that our documents delay somewhere in the port. But we cannot delay because of it so big ship departure, can we? - Rodopia argues.
- And we need a job, - Victor with a wise air affirms.
- Hm, well, guys, let’s go to...our...father – captain, and he’ll manage it...
- Well, with pleasure! - Rodopia almost cries.
The Senior goes first, after him two scapegraces follows nervously grimacing and gesticulating to each other. Boys with aimed rifles bristle above.
On the captain’s bridge:
- Docs, please.
One of them takes out from behind pocket of jeans a plastic pack, pulls out from it a passport and gives it to a captain. Rodopia stretches his arm under his vest so everybody strain and people with guns around clearly give to know that they have not just a toys in their hands and those are loaded.
- Quiet, without jerky moves, - they say him.
- Yes, yes, - he says and with quiver in his fingers carefully takes out a crumpled wallet extracting from it a threadbare passport and extend it to the captain.
- Rodopiy...in brackets (a) Valentine. Originally. Victor Freeman. So are you free? And Morgan or Gordon occasionally are not your kin? How are you get on the “Pilgrim”? - captain asks slowly and deliberately – a grey-headed and characteristically bearded man with noble image – and with interest raises his eyes and looks at them.
- So we just the same pilgrims here as you are, - Rodopia tries to start.
- We do not need high-society pathos here, - captain snubs him, - and you are not in list. These surnames I would have remembered, - he almost smiles.
- It seems to me that I need a potty. Can you tell me where is a toilet here? - Rodopia suddenly gets kid’s voice.
- We already explained to your man that our documents are delayed in port, - Victor understanding that he must to correct a situation decided to say a word, - and we need a job.
- Are you workers?
- Aha.
- Well, I can believe that you are a loader but your friend...extremely peculiar helper.
- I can be useful… - Rodopia quickly talks, - I can sing and dance. We are very glad to fall within your if not say Titanic let’s say very big ship.
- I do not recommend to say that name on my ship and a singing with dancing maybe you’ll demonstrate us later.
- So as I say not Tyrantic but a lovely ship with a lovely captain.
- Yes, the ship is perfect but I think you selected it not only because of it?
- Hm, yes, frankly speaking we try to get to the west, in Europe, - Victor says.
- Is something concrete attracts you there? - on these words friends exchange glances.
- You know, yes, I was not on my homeland for a long time and...moreover, there in France my girlfriend Flo lives, - Rodopiy smiles.
- Well, I see...As you know, we go to France, in 2 decades we will be on place. In 10 ports your service will come in very handy. I’ll order to accommodate you.
- Yoohoo, yoohoo, wee, we will sail to Paris, - Rodopia almost dances Sirtaki.
Next day in the morning walking on the deck they suddenly hear shrill female squeal behind their backs. “Woman on a ship is a bad sign,” - Rodopiy have time to think. They put their heads into shoulders, somehow lubberly turn around but nobody is there. They see above how a pipe emitting a steam or smoke already whistles loudly.
- Everybody, breakfast! - people cries and goes to back side of the ship.
- I hope this kind of call won't spoil my appetite, - taking his belly Rodopiy forces himself to speak.
Working days start. From Vladivostok they go to Taipei. They saw Taipei 101 tower but from a side because did not risk to land off a ship. They unloaded bales, containers and others.
Once Rodopia drops a big box on Victor’s foot. Victor cries out and takes his foot.
- You crushed my finger! - he spits out words through gritted teeth.
- Oh, oh, oh, don’t put your feet anywhere. And wear gloves, - Rodopiy shows his hands. Victor only close his eyes and shakes his head.
Next day Rodopia was sleeping 24 hours due to unusual tiredness.
- Ro-o-dick, o-o-ops, whose panties are these, ha? O-o-ops? - Victor holds in his hands and moves from side to side sometime was white foppish trousers of Rodopia.
- Stop kidding, give me the trousers!
- Catch me if you can! - Victor quickly jumps out of the cabin with the trousers in his hands.
The chase continues on the deck where they run across the board of the ship going upstairs by the ladders, slipping down by handrails rushing at full speed. Victor turns around, shouts with laughter and runs forward rejoicing at how he succeeded in brighten up his everyday morning training.
Rodopia cries angrily demanding to stop and give him back his cloths. White loose boxers with big red peas only flies in the wind with his shaggy hairs. And then Victor stops frightened – in his hand only big belt stays to hang. The trousers gaily spreading on the sun and waving by its legs flies down to the same jolly and joyful waves of the ocean.
- A-a-a, - Rodopia cries in panic looking at irretrievably going away trousers. People around that was lucky to see it merrily and leaping laugh.
- O-o-ops, trousers are outboard, - Victor can say only regretting about it and following with his eyes floating away cloths. He fearfully and blankly stretches his hand with only bare belt holding it like a dangerous cobra’s neck.
- Give it to me! - Rodopia shouts angrily seizing the belt in his hand and cracking his jaws starts to prepare it for cruel flogging, - Now I’ll make your life happy!
Victor, smelling a rat, puts forward his hands, trying to stop his friend, and gradually picks up speed moving backwards. And then stridently as at first time signal for breakfast chirps. Rodopia widely brandishing by the belt starts to get more velocity steaming as a railway engine which cannot be stopped and on which way better not to be.
Two hooligans on audition of captain:
- Sorry, captain, - Victor starts to vindicate ourselves, - we do not want to distract you, but I’m enforced to ask you for help. A ticklish situation arose.
On these words captain holding himself upright and as usual holding his arms folded behind his back makes some upraise on his toes with straight legs and again lowers himself for some reason or other rolling over his heels. The white underpants with peas strikes a captain’s eye.
- You see, my friend got cold, and I am ashamed of, - Victor continues, - that is why I would like to  show interest in have you some unnecessary material?
- As you know, any material is not unnecessary, - captain makes significant pause quite enough enjoyed all horror of their condition and leisurely continues, - excepting possibly that material which forms you, however...I’ll see what can we do...
Later we see how in cabin Victor by the patterns sews on the “Brother” sewing-machine a sailcloth in form of trousers. At last he contentedly groans, stands up, lifts up in his hands newly-fledged breeches which however have a form of the “O” letter but it’s not important already and offers to try on this article to skulking in a corner Rodopia. Looking at the mirror it was difficult to say that it was exactly suitable for his legs but nevertheless by their mutual agree “it” was better than nothing. In addition it was enveloping him loosely enough so eccentric he even starts like it in someway:
- On the other hand, it’s not too tight, - he concludes with satisfaction.
Later the ship moves further to Hong Kong.
- Great Bruce Lee lived and worked here! - Rodopiy with an air of importance announces and makes - “O-o-o-a-a-a” - hoisting his leg he wags it near Victor’s ear.
Then Victor recoups himself for his finger making ankle trip to impudent fighter which loudly falls and starts to rub the place below his back. Victor smiles, makes “O-a” too, elaborately turns his arms around his head and wave by hand to himself meaning Come on! But his friend for some reason has not that willing already. He stretches his arm to help recumbent to get up.
In Singapore they see the Marina Bay Sands hotel, at first worrying that some vessel was found on the rocks.
In capital of Sri Lanka (or in short Ceylon) Sri Jayawardenapura-Kotte they for long time tried to spell its name but later settle to name it just Kotte without Sri.
- I always loved Ceylon tea, - Victor says taking a sip of golden beverage from thin carved cup and effulgently smiling, - and now I know that for it we must thank to Lankans.
- Well, now you just looks like a satisfied tomcat, - Rodopia sprinkles.
- O, o, look what a beautiful elephant! - Victor continues to be amazed.
In Djibouti they only unload many bales, somebody mentions drainless lake Assal (near the lake Ghoubet), which by the grapevine is the most salt. In this hot weather it will not help them they thought.
In Suez they only hiccuped discussing that they cannot go now to Cairo with its pyramids so maybe next time. In Port Said, north terminal of Suez Canal, they only load-unload.
On approach to Athens they decide to make another trick. They gather several nets, plait them into some tresses and let down them from board hand-rails just before the name of the ship. In the morning in Athens port the ship named “My Pilgrim” enters.
- Very romantic, - captain utters, - however I order you to take off that garland now to prevent turmoil in port by letting so audacious liberty and breaking unwritten rule of clearance and readability of marine ship’s name. From this moment you will stay without dry rations for two days.
- But compote? - Rodopiy become upset.
- How can we left a little child without compote?
After such treatment Rodopia without notice of homeland visit gladness on the way to Tunisia totally grows sad, becomes pensive and out-of-body, starts to stay too long on the rostrum as he wanted faster to find himself at the destination.
One day as usual he stands on the rostrum holding on the handrails. Somebody from behind abruptly cries out:
- Hands up! Don’t turn around!
He was terrified and slowly lifts his arms up.
Somebody comes to him and starts to probe his trunk from sides, then passes down over his left trouser-leg then right trouser-leg. That man takes his arms and separates them to the sides.
And he whispers to his ear:
- We was discovered and they’re watching us. Do what I say. I’ll hold your arms. Do not resist. Stay still. Look at the smooth surface of the ocean ahead. Feel the beauty of the moment. Then start to cry as you like it. Start when I’ll tell you.
So lengthening their arms to the sides they stay for some time under the sidewinders.
- Now scream.
- O-h-o-o-o! O-o-o! Ye-a-a!
- Great! And now let me take your place.
Rodopiy steps aside, takes up a handrail and stays at some distance away from. Victor stands as Rodopiy was standing before holding the handrails. Hanging his head he looks at the starling below. Then he turns around and goes a little forward moving away from the rostrum. Then he stands still but with some strange pose as he prepares to jump, makes some bobs and suddenly pushing off by his legs makes a back somersault dive and appears outboard right about the rostrum. Rodopia loudly screams putting his fingers in his mouth:
- A-a-a-a, a man’s outboard!
With fear he comes to the rostrum hiding his eyes by his hand and separating them as usual looks by one eye down and sees head of Victor again which holds the sides of the ship and doing chin-ups counts something in low voice. Rodopiy takes away his hands from his face and somehow perplexedly and sceptically hems, slightly nods and starts to look at performance.
- 9, 10, - after a little hang he pulls himself up and seizing on handrails comes up on the board, - I always dreamed to make chin-ups on the rostrum.
- It seem to be that anybody has crazy fantasies, - psychiatrist Rodopia concludes strangely rolling his eyes.
- I have once more, - Victor says.
Once when ship was stopped he makes a beautiful jump from handrails of the poop, making in the air several overturns.
- A man’s outboard! - Rodopiy again cries out heart-rendingly and taking a rope with life-buoy ring starts to spin it as he was a dashing cowboy and throws it in pursuit of drowning man.
We see below how satisfied Victor swims up to life-buoy ring and takes it. And here Rodopiy pulls the rope to himself saving his friend. But when necessary of lift him up comes down he feels some difficulties:
- Hey, friends, help! - he cries, - Well, help us, please! A man is outboard!
Two boys come to him and hand in hand start to lift up but we cannot say that they was in rapture of it.
- Thank you, guys, - claping guys’ shoulders Victor says, - that’s all, that’s all, I won’t repeat it, - wiping his face and embracing Rodopia. Then they for some reason almost start to perform a slow and sad dance.
In Rome’s port the matter concerns Rodopia’s girlfriend Flo:
- Who is she? - Victor shows interest in.
- Her name is Florentia and by amusing coincidence she...is from Florence. But now she lives in France.
- So is she real? You never told me about her!
- I never told about her to anybody! - Rodopiy angers, - we had to fall apart and it’s all! No questions anymore!
Victor somewhat ironically looks at Rodopia and understands that the subject is really closed.
In Monaco they talks again:
- Do you know that the square of Monaco is only 2 square kilometers? This is the smallest country in the world! People’s density is almost 19 thousand per kilometer!
- Then we’d better stay here to avoid some throng… - Victor begins to think.
- And they organize there Grand Prix de Monaco through all country!
- Amazing!
Coming to Marseille guys throwing up their caps and gloves cries:
- Land! It’s land! - and with pleasure and laughter they start to embrace patting mercilessly each other.
Farewell with captain:
- We came to say goodbye, Alexey Victorovich.
- It seems to be that your journey comes to an end here?
- Yes.
- Well, I even had time to get accustomed to your escapades. We had no such fervour and gaiety for a long time.
- We was glad to meet you – legendary captain Smirnov! But I won’t cry now, - Victor was deeply moved.
- And don’t, we’ve water enough...Yes, and good luck with Flo, - captain cunningly winks at Rodopia and smiles.
- Thank you.
They embraced and slap each other on the back. Rodopiy wears a little through the white captain’s costume by his hand slightly dirtying it and respectfully steps backward.
Victor and captain shake hands firmly with elbow interception.
- Well, be good, maybe we’ll see each other somehow. Good luck on the shore.
From the cargo bay of the big ship two brave travelers go out in slow motion with dignity pacing upward to the camera. Almost historical cadres. They turn around and wave their hands to friends on the ship.
Moving away a little they quickly hide behind bales and containers.
- What we gonna do? - Victor asks his friend.
- How what? What for did I strive here? We swim to my girlfriend of course.
- Oh, yes, of course, where else your heaven girl may live? How can I miss… - Victor hits his forehead.
- Aha, she is a model. And she has own perfume line. You’ll feel it immediately...
At nightfall they ask one fisherman to take them to Cannes on his motorboat.
- So what, can you speak French? - Victor admires.
- No, but word “Cannes” he understood.
At the morning, in about 5 hours they were on place.
- Here every year in May Cannes Film Festival takes place and they give Golden Palm. I wish I could get it for my film… - Rodopiy dreams.
- Aha and I wish I could not get a jail for it.
Here Rodopiy blinks badly and shows the direction to move.
- I hope you know what are you doing, - with some anxiety Victor says following him.
- Did I ever let you down? - Rodopiy turns to him resentfully.
Doorbell rings:
- I hope she did not move, - Rodopia begins to fret.
- Yes?
- Is here Florentia live?
- Yes.
- A-a-a, m-m-m, please, open, this is Rodopiy. I am with my good friend Victor.
Pause. Silence. Click of opening door-lock.
- Hi, Flo. You looks great. Can we?
Severe glare of heavenly elvish eyes directs on Rodopia first then his friend:
- Good morning, come in, please, - taking away a door chain she utters.
With some sorrow following with her eyes greasy tousles of hapless director she closes the door. Her height was a little more than height of both.
- O, you have a great garden here! How beautiful!
- Thanks. By what destiny were you thrown here?
And here guys turn around and smile foolishly.
Drinking tea in a living-room:
- Such were the deals… - Rodopia ends sipping tea and pursing his lips.
- I always knew that you are master of finding adventures on your second ninety. Sorry, it is not about you…
- No, no, it’s ok… - Victor falters.
- I could help you, but how? Aren’t you in search?
- And as for this I have a plan! - contentedly throwing his brows Rodopiy smiles.
- For this smile I loved him… - unexpectedly breathes Florentia.
Getting in a barrel of water Rodopiy pulls his lips to lovely creature in blue dress. But instead a kiss he got powerful slap in the face and pitifully:
- What for?
And then she puts on his head a heavy cover with sea water strewed with littoral sand. Rodopiy dives down putting on his face a diving mask and taking in his mouth a breathing pipe that goes to the barrel’s side. Florentia puts on it all a second cover and occludes. The same another barrel stands near in the car’s luggage space.
She puts on a dark glasses, sits on driver’s seat and a car makes a move. Automatic gate closes smoothly after it.
Than we see flyovers, highways, posts, multitude of cars, beautiful views.
Roughly on a half of way her car catches road inspector's eye and he orders to stop.
Her car stops near roadside. We hear nervous gurgle in the cask.
- Please, your documents, madam. (They speak french).
She searches in a glove box, finds it and gives him. Takes off a glasses.
- Go far? - turning back the docs point duty officer asks.
- To Paris.
- Can I check your luggage?
- Yes, of course.
Back door opens, two barrels stand.
- What in the barrels?
- Sea...Cannes...littoral sand, - she says with emphasis on word “Cannes”.
- What for? - inspector amazes.
- I have my friend in Paris which very misses his home Cannes. He asked me to bring him a little sea and sand to put it on his plot – the part of his fatherland, so to speak, - she smiles nicely.
- Can I?
- Of course, - she says light-heartedly and opens the cover. We see there how water splashes over the layer of sea silt. Policeman for some reason puts his finger there and touches – real sand.
- Your friend apparently is very original! - policeman almost smiles.
- I think so too, - she smiles again, closing the cover. And we see her big frightened eyes looking at the camera in salon as she say “f-o-o-o, is it possible that it passed away?”
And here some swash or gurgling sounds in one of barrels.
- What’s that? - inspector pricks up his ears.
- Fishes must be, - she smiles guiltily.
- Well, bon voyage! -  pointsman smiling widely salutes.
- Thank you, - she says and car fluently moves and we see how in one of her soft and wet eyes a little limpid pea appears.
Measured pitching and rolling again. To the evening it ends.
The cover opens – let the light be! Diver upraises his head, takes off his mask and looks around.
- Are we in Paris already?
- Yes, in its surroundings. I won’t go with you further, I need to deliver the sand to my friend.
- Is he real? - suddenly jealously Rodopiy asks.
- Of course, - hemming Flo says gaily and adds, - Did you think that I will go at random as you?
- Well, and who is that your big original?
- So what a difference to you? You’ve lost for 5 years!
- Inter alia, you asked me to wait by yourself. And I’ve waited as long as I could!
Here the next barrel starts to flounder about.
- A, o, help, please, now to my big friend, - Rodopiy begins to bustle about trying to scramble out.
- I thank you heavenly creature for coming from the skies, - unexpectedly poetically for himself Victor blesses her.
- Hey, no, no! - Rodopiy was indignant, - See! Too many big friends here!
- Your cloths, - throwing a bag, Flo sits on the driver’s place.
- Wait, wait, will I see you again? - with entreaty Rodopia appeals to her in car window.
- Hm, - hanging her head she thinks, - anywhere you go you’d have internet.
She takes a piece of paper and writes on it with beautiful flowered letters: "florentiamay@gmail.com" and reaches out it to him.
He happily wants to take it but she takes the leaf aside. He gets upset. She smiles and gives it for real. He even slavers.
- Ciao, dear, - she says and car passes away. Rodopia in his hand voluptuously holds a white leaf of plain note paper that smells with all delicate aromas of France.
- Hey, Romeo, who will be dressed? - Victor hails.
- Do you see this? - Rodopia gaily waves right under Victor’s very nose by the leaf, - she gave it only to me, to me, my big friends! And do you feel what aroma? This is the best kind of opium!
- Yes, pleasant girl, - smiling Victor agrees and dims remembering his Eugenia and lamentably continues, - but my probably with an abdomen, - he thinks pulling on his trousers.
- Don’t worry, we’ll get out of it, - Rodopia tries to soothe.
They comes to Eiffel Tower.
- Most likely, there is internet-cafe there.
Connecting to internet guys links to Dmitriy.
E-mail from him comes:
- You will be amazed but he has dinner near you right now. Try to find him looking around.
They start to look around and really he sits next table behind the wall talking about something with partner briskly.
- If coincidence so only thus! - Rodopia rejoices.
Waited when they go for smoke lads pretend as they walk by the room of cafe in search of better view and then go to the window. Victor accidentally hooks up Andrey’s chair by his leg, has time for quickly catch of falling notebook that was leaned to table’s leg, imperceptibly changes it on the same which they specially bought beforehand and enjoys a view talking over the mellowness of tree’s leaves.
Sitting on his table Victor enters in slot of notebook a special memory card that starts to twinkle multicoloredly.
On screen he enters password “Superman343”, clicks on program from flash-card by the right button of touch-pad, in slide-down menu selects “Run as Administrator” and disk-copy process starts. It goes fast enough, it needed about half-hour to finish. They sit and discuss beautiful views of Paris and also variants where they can go.
Here behind Andrey suddenly stands up from the table with his friend and goes to our friends. Victor understands that they go to their table and quickly turning around the notebook to Rodopia says:
- Look at this crazy photo!
Rodopia understands that several minutes left and makes astonished face:
- What the…! Where were you?
Men pass away. Timer counts seconds, not far away Andrey stands with his friend and looks at a view of window.
Rodopia nervously knocks the table by his fingers when at last process was finished. He tears off the flash-card, they both stand up and go behind the wall, stumble over unfortunate chair again and return to their table. They quickly prepare, leave cash and go to exit.
In other cafe they send the content of flash-card to Dmitriy’s cloud thanks to marvelous speed of internet.
- Nice job, guys, about in three hours get on the link and do it better from other place, I’ll tell you results.
They unhurriedly walk by Av. des Champs-Élysées when decide to take a look in one of cafes.
- Y-e-e-a, guys, it’s not too densely here. I did not find anything like video-records or something.
- How is that?
- Yes, notebook is clean. However judging by calendar notes he did a copy on external drive. Probably, he keeps it at his home in a safe place, for example, in safe.
- Are we long eagerly for this far in vain? - Victor cries when they out of cafe.
- Calm down, Victor, we are here not in vain, after all I met my ex-girlfriend and we have seen so much things.
- And so what?! - he cannot quiet down, - damn, I’ll kill him! How, you think, we can go back, ha?!
- If you will cry so hard, we’ll go there by first class! - Rodopia cries him in response, but was too late. Two policemen go to them. One of them was ready to get out his gun.
- O, let’s talk later, - Victor throws the words quickly, - but for now we’d better run!
They run in side street. Policemen follow. They run good, quickly, eyefully, almost pushing aside passerby, dashingly jumping over barriers and flowerbeds. Victor drops out on the road. Some car’s hood throws him up. He gets up quickly, runs to driver, opens the door and with words - “I really need it!” - flings out the driver, sits on his place, Rodopia here runs up to and sits near and they sharply dart off. Policemen reach fallen driver, one of them helps him to get up, other talks by radio.
Soon police cars fly towards. Victor harshly twirls a steer and bolts from two cars. Tomatoes, boxes, rags, different small carts flies and everything that can fly that appears on the way of escaping from the chase car. The red signal lights up, Victor stops right before the crosswalk, old woman goes on it slowly with travel carriage, police cars stand almost near, behind two cars, but nobody goes out from there and tries to arrest them. All quietly wait the green light. After it the chase immediately starts with the same strength and pressure.
- Listen, - hardly holding a handle of his window Rodopia creams, - where are you go?
- To the port of course!
- We are in Paris!
- Then we go to the south of Paris! - and here in side window of Victor watermelon comes and smashes by the glass.
In one of police car’s salon:
- We’re chasing a black hatchback, the number is so-so, two men, goes quickly and dangerous, to all appearance they move to the south. We have two cars and we need reinforcement promptly or blockade on the south exit of Paris.
- We got it, we see and analyze the situation, we’ll inform you later, continue to pursuit and try to not let them go.
Moving intuitively by the evening sun Victor strives to drive on low-loaded and wide streets, to do it he was obliged to go through oncoming traffic. Drivers scarcely have time to evade a crazy rider. Once a driver of approaching car, also sport-car, having time to avoid a crash and flying near in drift  and slow motion blinks looking straight in Victor’s eyes with some delight and stops behind. On one crossing he was necessitated to run on red and turn to the left from right lane and from where a red car was moving quite fast. Its driver caught a sight of Victor’s car and turned steeply to the right to prevent a collision and his car drifts to the left naturally. Victor’s car was in left turn and drifts to the right exactly avoiding a contact. Amusing tyre vestige appears on the crossing that camera sees from the top. Red car stops on the cross closing way for police. Victor’s car straighten up and moves as nothing changed. On the next cross big truck with semitrailer moves crosswise. We have a prediction that Victor will dive under the semitrailer moving through and breaking the roof. But he turns to the left atilt and the car drifts greatly and it starts to spin on the place but still moves forward when the prime mover almost leaves the cross, the car stops to spin and revolve and goes further. All this time Rodopia screams as crazy so we can see how his uvula dangles.
There is a sign “Road works” ahead. We see some swelling like ramp and Victor at high speed goes on it. A road worker carrying a sack appears under it. The car flies above him and touches his sack. The worker was glad that he is in helmet. The tires could squeal for a long time but they see many police cars and spikes. Victor stops the car slightly turning it to the left. From behind two cars block up the way also stopping sideways. Policemen aim the guns on transgressors. Megaphone talks:
- Get out of the car, you are blockaded! And without flub-dub!
They get out.
- Put your hands on the air so that we can see it!
They raise their hands. Two policemen comes from behind.
- Hands on the hood! I said hands on the hood! - one of them cries.
By the tone they guess and do what they say. They search them, put handcuffs and leads them to cars.
They was accused in illegal being in France, disobedience of police orders, car theft and damage of associate property and got 8 month with correctional labour. Later from Russia comes information about suspicion of terrorism. They decided that they will serve their sentence in France and later be deported to Russia for further trial.
We see how already not shaggy but bald Rodopia stands near the wall, jailer opens the bars and shows to prisoner to go further.
- Oui, monsieur, oui, - Rodopia says and goes forward.
Then he comes to Victor sitting about the wall of walking yard.
- Yea, everything goes badly, - he says leaning against the wall.
- Yea...
- But as I said we’ll fly to fatherland by first class!
- On what route are you work?
- On E5, sometimes on E15, was on E50, they change always.
- So too I.
We see how they alternately move the bags on the road, then work with spade, hammer. Prison cell’s bars, walking, basketball, chess, the Florence picture on the wall, cups and other bagatelle, sometimes the news about far Russia on TV. Long times of thinking in twilight. Eugenia’s image saying about pregnancy and friend’s call. Victor’s head hangs, then ups again. He looks at latticed window of the ward. The lines of bars is on his face with bitterness of regret and helplessness. He wipes his face by hand but it’s useless. He stands up, leans to bars and looks at the horizon.
Title: 8 month later.
Early spring. Plane boarding.
- I said, first class! - satisfied nevertheless somewhere sad Rodopia’s face, - we go home, home! - he cries out.
- And my probably with baby! - Victor cries gaily.
First thing that he do in Moscow was a call to Eugenia. But man’s voice answers:
- Yes?
- A, o, can I hear Eugenia?
- A-a-a, you know, long time they call me and ask Eugenia, I got this number almost 3 month ago. She perhaps changed her number.
- M-m-m, then sorry.
Grieved and despairing stare of Victor.
Long hearing, nude justifications of Rodopia, appeals and repeated appeals, request to let them closer to their land.
- Let me to see my child at least! - Victor screams, - Damn! I’m innocent!
Everybody see that it was a cry from the heart.
- Here was the stone with board. When I ran, it, seemingly, jumped and fell from steep.
- Do you fix this testimony?
- Yes.
- What was next?
- We want to believe you, but it is too incredible, - trying hard to suppress his laugh expert says.
- But it was really so!
- You have no true evidence. We cannot take into consideration a childish prattle. Results of expertise for criminal sanity were affirmative. It shouldn't to joke with this testimony. It may be interpreted as a try to complicate the investigation. Your friend repeats the same that looks like a collusion and coordinated actions. It’s not the argument in favour of you.
- The evidence was seized by detective of “Moon reflection”!
- Add this to the case, - expert says to his assistant, - yes, we have results of his interrogation but they say against you. You can be saved only by a miracle and apparently you are hoping on it. Experts analyze information on given by you record data medium trying to recover the data however the prognosis for now is unfavorable. We have some reasons to suppose that you damaged it right in time of crime’s perpetration.
- What about the fact that the data storage was some time in detective’s hands?
- It was not proven. We have data – video surveillance camera records, testimonial evidences – that you tried to seize his camera however it wasn’t proven that videocamera which was in hands of detective in time of chase is exactly that camera which later was given to investigation by you.
- But fingerprints?
- Only yours.
- Pedant! - remembering white gloves of Andrey Victor cries.
- And your anger is not helping you.
Victor lose hope to defense and resign himself to deprivation preparing himself to serve any time appointed by the court.
They both got 5 years.
Title: 4 years later.
Once upon a time going in surroundings of Abutting-Hill to remember that strange case the investigator wanders into the hill a little higher and starts to thoughtfully look down at the place of crime. His uninteresting look forebodes nothing unusual. Tired a little from monotone sitting he awkwardly moves his leg that become numb. And here his boot’s toe convulsively hits some stone that rolls away showing some bright thing. He looks at it more attentively. Then he stretching out gets broken phone with shaken screen. Merely mechanically he gets out a pocket for evidence and puts it in just in case decided to give it for expertise.
The results of expertise were somewhat dumbfound. On the phone of a certain Rose quite high quality video record of that crime’s moment was stored with all details.
The re-examination of the case was started, Victor was discharged and cleared of all accusations, Rodopia was sent into exile for 2 years with correctional labour as punishment for culpable dereliction of duty when organize of production process without approval to do filming and failure to comply with rules of safety measures. Andrey Pogodin was accused of giving false evidence and information hiding – the search of his apartment revealed the data of crime process recorded on laser disk.
Victor comes to his friend in exile.
- How are you?
- So-so, little by little, working here. As I did not work before.
- Hold on, brother, it will help you.
- I thought that you are my friend, - Rodopiy was offended.
- That’s why I say, - Victor smiles.
They hug one another.
Frayed stairwell, glazed with grid floor in Khrushchevka (standardized, mass-produced five-storey apartment block (an icon of government housing policy during the Khrushchev era 1953 - 1964; though often despised for poor design and workmanship, it played a key role in the mass movement out of communal and into separate family apartments). Doorbell rings. After pause door opens. He sees there formerly leaved girlfriend. Door abruptly with rattle closes. 5 minutes we see only bare door. Silence and stillness. Victor looks down and turns away with disappointment. And then squeak of the door sounds and it opens. Big eyes of 5-years boy in the door. He looks at the guest. Mute scene.
- Uncle?
